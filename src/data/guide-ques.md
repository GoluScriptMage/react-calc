🧠 Prompt Title: "The Missing Flavors Prompt Pack: For Emotionless Love, Dry Friendship, Pressure-Free Career, and Every Personality Vibe"

This prompt will generate new question ideas for each of your 4 calculators (Love 💖, Friendship 🤝, Career 🚀, Personality 🌈) — but specifically covering themes that were missing before.


---

🌟 Format for Each Entry:

Category: Love / Friendship / Career / Personality

Theme: (e.g. Emotionless Love, Funny but Serious Career, Overlooked Personality Trait)

Question: (A short, engaging and quirky one-liner)

Options: 4 MCQ-style answers (each with personality or emotion nuance)

Score Mapping Idea: (What kind of score it might lean toward)



---

Here’s the detailed prompt to feed into Copilot or use manually to generate fresh questions:


---

> “Generate unique, engaging multiple-choice questions for a React-based interactive personality quiz app.
The quiz has 4 categories:

Love 💖

Friendship 🤝

Career 🚀

Personality 🌈


For each question:

Write one fun, teasing, relatable or insightful one-liner question.

Provide 4 multiple-choice options, each with a distinct tone or personality behind it.

Make each option subtly reflect emotions, attitudes, or behavioral patterns, so that they can be scored and mapped.


Focus on filling the gaps that were missing in earlier versions:


---

🔥 LOVE SECTION — Add Missing Feelings & Depths

Lack of emotions (numbness, indifference, lost spark)

One-sided relationships (you give, they take)

Ghosting, mixed signals, slow fading

Overthinking vs underreacting in relationships

Realistic love vs fantasy love

“I’m not sure if I still feel anything” zone


Examples:

“You’re on a call with your crush. You feel...?”

“Someone says 'I love you' but you just smile. Why?”



---

😂 FRIENDSHIP SECTION — Add Funless, Dry or Realistic Bonds

Friendships that feel boring or forced

You miss laughing but don’t know why

Ghost friends or one-sided effort

Situational friendships (classroom friends, no real bond)

Deep desire for connection but social exhaustion


Examples:

“Your ‘bestie’ hasn’t texted in weeks. Your reaction?”

“Your friends made a group plan. You weren’t invited. You feel...?”



---

💼 CAREER SECTION — Add Serious-Funny Mix, Pressure-Free Mindsets

When you’re ambitious but feel no pressure

“Everyone’s running, I’m walking and vibing” energy

Self-employment dreams, but chill attitude

You don’t fear failure — or success

Career jokes that hit hard but stay soft


Examples:

“Office job or jungle safari?”

“When someone says ‘what’s your 5-year plan’ you say...?”



---

🎭 PERSONALITY SECTION — Add Rare, Chaotic, or Peaceful Vibes

Calm but unpredictable

Hyper but self-aware

Introvert who acts like an extrovert (and vice versa)

You feel like 10 personalities in one body

You switch vibes faster than playlists


Examples:

“How do you usually enter a room full of strangers?”

“What’s your real default mood?”



---

❗ Make sure each question is fun, real, sometimes vulnerable, but not too heavy.
❗ Format clearly so it’s usable in a JavaScript object structure later.
❗ Score mapping should be easy to assign (like 1–4).
❗ Keep balance between serious and playful.
❗ No cringe forced humor — let it be honest or chaotic.




---

🌟 Bonus: Seed Keywords List

You can give Copilot or your brain this list to play with:

Keywords:
- Emotional burnout, apathy, tired of love, grey zone, numb heart
- Fake smiles, dry laughter, ghost friendships, hollow hangouts
- Chilling through career, “I’ll see”, not serious but smart, lazy genius
- Calm chaos, identity shifts, quiet rebels, inner monologues, vibe switch


---

🧩 Output Example (If You Want to Preload Yourself):

Category: Love
Theme: Emotionless / Numbness

A. Nothing. I just nod or smile.  
B. Overthink everything, then ghost them.
